Needed:


CONTENT_LENGTH = The length of request body
--> Parse from request headers
--> NULL if request has no body

CONTENT_TYPE = The type of body
--> Parse from request headers
--> NULL if request has no body

GATEWAY_INTERFACE = dialect (?) of CGI being used
--> Let's just use a default of CGI/1.1

PATH_INFO = A path that starts from the script's "root folder"
--> need to get the scripts folder + add possible extra from the request header
--> ASK FOR HELP

QUERY_STRING = Additional information concatonated to the URI
--> Parse URI until you find ?, everything after that is Query String
--> set "", if no ? is found

REMOTE_ADDR = client's IP address
--> Get from the socket...?
--> ASK FOR HELP

REQUEST_METHOD = The request method (GET, POST etc)
--> Parse from request header

SCRIPT_NAME = / + scriptfile name
--> parse from header

SERVER_NAME = The name of the server
--> Get from config parser

SERVER_PORT = The port number where the request came from
--> Get from serverInfo -struct...?

SERVER_PROTOCOL = The HTTP protocol used
--> SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.1



Is this needed...?


PATH_TRANSLATED = PATH_INFO translated into a whole directory path inside the server's filesystem
--> For example: if request is : http://localhost:8080/home/cgi/helloScript.php
--> PATH_INFO is "/"
--> PATH_TRANSLATED is "/home/pkangas/Desktop/webserv/home/cgi/helloScript.php
--> But do we need this...? Probably not, ASK AROUND

REMOTE_HOST = the host name of client (for example google.com)
--> Seems irrelevant and unnecessary
--> ASK AND CONFIRM

SERVER_SOFTWARE = the name and version of the information server software making the CGI request
--> Is this necessary, since we don't name our software...?
--> Oor maybe just webserv/1.1...?




Not needed:

AUTH_TYPE = Information about server authentication 
--> can be "" for us
--> ASK AND CONFIRM

REMOTE_IDENT = Information regarding the client connection
--> Not mandatory!

REMOTE_USER = User_id used for authentication
--> If AUTH_TYPE is not needed, then this is also not needed
